notes/comments for self
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Serial data is very confusing at first
*C++/vb.net give me more trouble than expected, even though i have a lot of vba experience
*the arduino code is slowly becoming more readable, sleeping after running into roadblocks has helped
*more things i need to learn beyond gnat stats (static? char?)
*need to figure out how serial data can be read, the entire issue with gnat stats was that I was not able to read
 what data was being sent over serial, i had to guess what it was by the provided code.
